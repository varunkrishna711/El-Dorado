                    <p className='describe'>Kathakali (Malayalam: കഥകളി) is a major form of classical Indian dance.[1] It is a "story play" genre of art, but one distinguished by the elaborately colourful make-up, costumes and face masks that the traditionally male actor-dancers wear.[2][3][note 1] Kathakali is a performing art in the Malayalam-speaking southwestern region of Kerala.[2][3][5]


Kathakali is one of the eight classical dances of India

Kathakalī's roots are unclear. The fully developed style of Kathakalī originated around the 17th century, but its roots are in the temple and folk arts (such as Krishnanattam and religious drama of the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut) southwestern Indian peninsula), which are traceable to at least the 1st millennium CE.[2][6] A Kathakali performance, like all classical dance arts of India, synthesizes music, vocal performers, choreography and hand and facial gestures together to express ideas. However, Kathakali differs in that it also incorporates movements from ancient Indian martial arts and athletic traditions of South India.[2][3][5] Kathakalī also differs in that the structure and details of its art form developed in the courts and theatres of Hindu principalities, unlike other classical Indian dances which primarily developed in Hindu temples and monastic schools.[2][6]

The traditional themes of the Kathakalī are folk stories, religious legends and spiritual ideas from the Hindu epics and the Puranas.[7] The vocal performance has traditionally been performed in Sanskritised Malayalam.[6] In modern compositions, Indian Kathakali troupes have included women artistes,[4] and adapted Western stories and plays such as those by Shakespeare.[8]</p>

                        <p className='histdet'>Elements and aspects of Kathakalī are taken from ancient Sanskrit texts such as the Natya Shastra.[11] The kathakali is attributed to sage Bharata, and its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE,[12][13] but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE.[14]

The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters.[12][15] The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures – all of which are part of Indian classical dances including Kathakali.[11][12][16] Dance and performance arts, states this ancient Hindu text,[17] are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures.[18]

The roots of Kathakalī are unclear. Jones and Ryan state it is more than 500 years old. Kathakalī emerged as a distinct genre of performance art during the 16th and 17th centuries in a coastal population of south India that spoke Malayalam (now Kerala).[19] The roots of Kathakalī, states Mahinder Singh, are more ancient and some 1500 years old.[20]</p>

                        <h3 className='smallhead'>Costumes</h3>
                        <p className='costdet'>Of all classical Indian dances, Kathakali has the most elaborate costuming consisting of head dresses, face masks and vividly painted faces.[10][34][35] It typically takes several evening hours to prepare a Kathakali troupe to get ready for a play.[36][37] Costumes have made Kathakali's popularity extend beyond adults, with children absorbed by the colors, makeup, light and sound of the performance.[24]

The makeup follows an accepted code, that helps the audience easily identify the archetypal characters such as gods, goddesses, demons, demonesses, saints, animals and characters of a story.[38] Seven basic makeup types are used in Kathakali, namely Pachcha (green), Pazhuppu (ripe), Kathi, Kari, Thaadi, Minukku and Teppu.[38] These vary with the styles and the predominant colours made from rice paste and vegetable colors that are applied on the face.[10][39] Pachcha (green) with lips painted brilliant coral red portrays noble characters and sages such as Krishna, Vishnu, Rama, Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Nala and philosopher-kings.[40]

Thaadi (red) is the code for someone with an evil streak such as Dushasana and Hiranyakashipu. Some characters have a green face (representing heroic or excellence as a warrior) with red dots or lines on their cheeks or red-coloured moustache or red-streaked beard (representing evil inner nature), while others have a full face and beard coloured red, the latter implying excessively evil characters.[41] Kari (black) is the code for forest dwellers, hunters, and middle ground character.[42] Demonesses and treacherous characters are also painted black but with streaks or patches of red.[42]

Yellow is the code for monks, mendicants, and women. Minukka (radiant, shining) with a warm yellow, orange or saffron typifies noble, virtuous feminine characters such as Sita, Panchali and Mohini.[42] Men who act the roles of women also add a false top knot to their left and decorate it in a style common to the region.[42] Vella Thadi (white beard) represents a divine being, someone with virtuous inner state and consciousness such as Hanuman.[41] Teppu is for special characters found in Hindu mythologies, such as Garuda, Jatayu and Hamsa who act as messengers or carriers, but do not fit the other categories.[42] Face masks and headgear is added to accentuate the inner nature of the characters. The garments colours have a similar community accepted code of silent communication.[43]</p>
